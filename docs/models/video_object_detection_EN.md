## ðŸ“Œvideo-object-detection-StreamYOLO ##
### Introduction
This model is a real-time general detection model based on [StreamYOLO](https://github.com/yancie-yjr/StreamYOLO)ï¼Œand supports detection of8 types of traffic objects. Based on the YOLOX model, it uses the Dual-Flow Perception feature fusion module to learn temporal relationships at the feature level to improve environmental perception and prediction. Additionally, StreamYOLO employs a Trend-Aware Loss to perceive the intensity of object motion changes, which is used to weigh object prediction regression. This allows objects with more severe motion changes to receive higher regression weights, resulting in better prediction results. This model is trained on the Argoverse-HD dataset and is suitable for object detection in autonomous driving scenarios.

### Inference
You can experience the effect using the single-model inference function, currently supporting CPU/GPU inference. Please refer to the [inference documentation](../infer/infer_tutorial_EN.md)å’Œ[inference configuration example](../../configs/infer/model_infer.yaml)ï¼Œplease modify the key parameters of the configuration file as followsï¼š

```yaml
vis_flag: False
adadet_infer:
  type: 'ModelScopePipeline'
  task: 'video-object-detection'
  model_id: 'damo/cv_cspnet_video-object-detection_streamyolo'
```

### Performance
The performance of the model on the validation set of Argoverse-HD are as follows:
